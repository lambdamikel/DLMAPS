This directory contains versions of DL KBs from various applications.  We
do not have have complete information on the genesis of all the KBs, so
please do not redistribute them.

Most of the KBs have various versions.  In general 
   <KB>.tkb is a KB without any individuals (except, maybe, numbers), 
   <KB>-roles.tkb is that KB with all roles converted to primitive atomic
		  roles, 
   <KB>-classic.tkb is that KB with also some syntax changes so that it can
		    be read by NeoClassic,
   <KB>.akb is that KB with some individuals restored,
   <KB>-roles.akb is the obvious combination, and
   <KB>-classic.akb is the obvious combination.

The .tree files are a dump of the child-parent relationships in the
taxonomy.  If a later concept is equivalent to an earlier concept in the KB, it
will not show up in the .tree file.

Files with other extensions are closer to the original KB.
