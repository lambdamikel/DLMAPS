                              FaCT v1.9
=====================================================================



Obtaining FaCT
--------------

The latest version of FaCT can be obtained from:

	www.cs.man.ac.uk/~horrocks/FaCT



Installing FaCT
---------------

After downloading the FaCT distribution file type:

	gunzip FaCT.tar.gz ; tar xvf FaCT.tar

to create a directory "FaCT" containing the distribution files and
directories.

Presumably you already got that far if you are reading this.

There is a Makefile to help you complete the installation. You must
edit the first line of this file so that it indicates the command you
use to run your LISP. By default this command is set to "lisp".

To compile FaCT (and some other LISP stuff) type:

	make compile

To build the user manual using LaTeX, type:

	make manual

To run a set of tests based on randomly generated propositional modal
K(m) formulae and create a postscript document (in the Results/Latex
directory) containing plots of all the results type:

	make test

In the directory "Tboxes" there is a large Tbox (galen.tbox) derived
from the GALEN project which you can use to experiment with
FaCT. Names have been changed to protect the innocent. There are also
two slightly modified versions of the Tbox which can be used with the
KRIS system for comparative purposes: in galen-kris-1.tbox general
inclusion axioms have been pre-absorbed into primitive concept
introductions; in galen-kris-2.tbox they have been have been replaced
with non-primitive concept definitions (because galen-kris-1.tbox
gives KRIS indigestion).
